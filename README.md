# Top-100-metal-albums
This is a SQL based project where I analyze a dataset with the top 100 metal albums in Rolling Stone magazine's opinion.

In order to open the .db and .sqbpro files, please download and install the DB Browser for SQLITE here: https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/

Once you download and install DB Browser for SQLITE, please:

* Click on **file**
* Click on **Open Project** and search for the **bands.sqbpro** file
* Choose the **Bands.db** file
* That's it! You may run my queries with no problem. 

Otherwise, I've left the data sources folder with the .csv files used to create the different tables.
